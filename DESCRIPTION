Description: A dynamic genome-scale modelling of E. coli fermentation including batch,
    fed-batch and induction phases for recombinant protein expression. It's implemented
	with static optimization approach (SOA). First, the simulation time is divided into
	small periods which are assumed to be in quasi-steady state; Second, for every time 
	step, an flux balance analysis (FBA) problem is solved and the fluxes are integrated
	over the time period and extracellular concentrations are calculated, accordingly.
